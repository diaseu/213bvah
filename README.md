## ðŸš€ Technology Used

1.  **`React`**

2.  **`Gatsby`**

3.  **`SASS`**

4.  **`Font Awesome`**

## ðŸŽ“ Highlights

This project utilizes some helper files (developed and maintained by Dia) to quickly setup a lean customized style framework. It also utilizes CSS Modules to keep styles locally scoped.

    ./styles/
    â”œâ”€â”€ _helpers.scss
    â”œâ”€â”€ _theme.scss
    â”œâ”€â”€ _typography.scss
    â”œâ”€â”€ _variable.scss

**`_typography.scss`**: Font families are imported and maintained here, as well as font scalability for responsiveness

**`_helpers.scss`**: Mixins for device responsive breakpoints as well as ease-of-use like flex columns/rows, full width/half width, etc

**`_variables.scss`**: Theme variables set here, such as primary color, accent color, background color, as well as some theme-specific placeholder selectors. Plans to migrate placeholder selectors to \_theme.scss at a later point.
