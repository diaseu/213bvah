## 🚀 Technology Used

1.  **`React`**

2.  **`Gatsby`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`SASS`**: This application is deployed on Netlify

4.  **`Font Awesome`**: Font Awesome icons

## 🎓 Highlights

This project utilizes some helper files (developed and maintained by Dia) to quickly setup a lean customized style framework. It also utilizes CSS Modules to keep styles locally scoped.

    ./styles/
    ├── _helpers.scss
    ├── _theme.scss
    ├── _typography.scss
    ├── _variable.scss

**`_typography.scss`**: Font families are imported and maintained here, as well as font scalability for responsiveness

**`_helpers.scss`**: Mixins for device responsive breakpoints as well as ease-of-use like flex columns/rows, full width/half width, etc

**`_variables.scss`**: Theme variables set here, such as primary color, accent color, background color, as well as some theme-specific placeholder selectors. Plans to migrate placeholder selectors to \_theme.scss at a later point.
